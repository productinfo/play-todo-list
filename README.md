Cloning or downloading the project
------------------
This project uses git submodules to include some code common to various **shinobiplay** projects.

If you clone this project using GitHub Desktop, the submodules should be checked out automatically for you. Otherwise you can fetch the submodules on the command line using:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    
If you [download the zip](../../archive/master.zip) rather than cloning the project, you'll also have to download the submodule zips:

* Download [play-utils](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/play-utils/archive/master.zip) and extract its contents into the *ToDoList/ShinobiPlayUtils/** directory.

Your directory structure should end up looking something like this:

    .
    └── ToDoList
        ├── ToDoList
        ├── ToDoList.xcodeproj
        └── ShinobiPlayUtils
            └── ShinobiPlayUtils
                ├── ShinobiPlayUtils
                └── ShinobiPlayUtils.xcodeproj
                
Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of **shinobiessentials**. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [**shinobicontrols** website](https://www.shinobicontrols.com).

You'll need to add the links to the **shinobiessentials** bundle to the project. Open up the project in Xcode, then open your **shinobiessentials** download in finder, and drag ShinobiEssentials.bundle from finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group.

If you haven't run the**shinobiessentials** installer, you'll also need drag ShinobiEssentials.framework into Xcode's 'frameworks' group.

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up **ToDoListViewController.m** and add the following line inside `viewDidLoad`:

    [ShinobiEssentials setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
